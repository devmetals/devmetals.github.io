                            We believe that recycling is not just an environmental tool but an economic tool as well. Recycling and Waste reduction offer direct development opportunities for communities. When collected with skill and care, and upgraded with quality in mind, discarded materials are a resource that can contribute to local revenue, job creation, business expansion, and the local economic base.

                            <h3>So what does the new record for the lowest level of winter ice actually mean</h3>
                            <p>The Arctic Ocean freezes every winter and much of the sea-ice then thaws every summer, and that process will continue whatever happens with climate change. Even if the Arctic continues to be one of the fastest-warming regions of the world, it will always be plunged into bitterly cold polar dark every winter. And year-by-year, for all kinds of natural reasons, there’s huge variety of the state of the ice.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                For a start, it does not automatically follow that a record amount of ice will melt this summer. More important for determining the size of the annual thaw is the state of the weather as the midnight sun approaches and temperatures rise. But over the more than 30 years of satellite records, scientists have observed a clear pattern of decline, decade-by-decade.

                                                We believe that recycling is not just an environmental tool but an economic tool as well. Recycling and Waste reduction offer direct development opportunities for communities. When collected with skill and care, and upgraded with quality in mind, discarded materials are a resource that can contribute to local revenue, job creation, business expansion, and the local economic base.
